    <title>KPIT Aftersales: Interactive SaaS & AI Opportunity Analysis</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as a top-down strategic dashboard. It starts with a high-level summary of the market challenge, then guides the user to the four core 'Pain Points'. These pain points act as interactive filters for the main section: a gallery of the five 'Proposed Solutions'. Clicking a solution opens a detailed modal with a process flow and a dynamic radar chart for comparative analysis. This structure was chosen over a linear report format to allow users to explore solutions based on the specific business problems they solve, promoting a user-centric, non-linear discovery path that is more engaging and intuitive for strategic decision-making. The application concludes with an interactive competitive landscape and a visual 'Go-to-Market' strategy. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Market Challenge (Inform): Key stats are presented in high-contrast cards. Goal: Quickly establish the business context.
        - Pain Points (Organize/Filter): Interactive cards with icons. Goal: Frame the problems and serve as the primary navigation/filtering mechanism for the solutions. Interaction: Click to filter. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Proposed Solutions (Compare/Inform): A filterable grid of cards. Goal: Allow users to compare potential products at a glance. Interaction: Filter buttons and clickable cards. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Solution Details (Inform/Compare): A modal view with a 'How it Works' process flow (HTML/Tailwind) and a dynamic radar chart (Chart.js/Canvas). Goal: Provide deep insight into each solution and enable multi-attribute comparison. Interaction: The chart is dynamically generated. Justification: A radar chart is ideal for comparing multiple quantitative/qualitative metrics (value, data dependency, etc.) for a single item.
        - Competitive Landscape (Compare): Interactive table. Goal: Make dense competitor data easy to parse. Interaction: Row hover/selection. Method: HTML/Tailwind/JS.
        - Go-to-Market Strategy (Inform): A visual flowchart. Goal: Clearly communicate the recommended strategic path. Method: HTML/Tailwind. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
